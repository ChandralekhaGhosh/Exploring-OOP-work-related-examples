# Exploring-OOP-work-related-examples

OOP with Practical example:

This is my attempt to explore different OOP concepts by applying them to practical problems.

As I work in media audit & analytics, one of my responsibilities is to evaluate performance of multiple Digital platforms ( like, Facebook, Google, etc.) for campaigns, broadly by calculating Cost Per Unit Delivery.

Before looking into the code, request you to kindly have a look into the basic broad metrics to evaluate the digital channel's performances. The metrics used here are by no means give a complete picture, however, used here for simplicity's sake.

CPU-Cost Per Unit Deliveries Types of deliveries: Number of leads, number of clicks, number of impressions, number of views, etc.

Types of basic CPU:

Cost Per Lead =Spend/Number of Leads
CPC- Cost Per Lead =Spend/Number of Clicks
CPM- Cost Per Lead =Spend/Number of Impressions*1000
CPV- Cost Per Lead =Spend/Number of Views
Thank You!
